# Hare RFC

We collect specifications for APIs, file formats, wire protocols, and
processes.

* A specification is created and modified by pull requests according to
  [PC3](rfc/9/README.md).
* Each specification has an editor who publishes the RFC to
  github.com as needed.
* Specification lifecycle SHOULD follow the lifecycle defined in
  [COSS](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS).
* Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on Raw and Draft specifications.
