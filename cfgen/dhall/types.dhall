    This provides a convenient import to obtain all available types.

    Users will typically use this import to access constructors for various
    union types, like this:
    ```
    let types = ./types.dhall
    let defaults = ./defaults.dhall
    in    defaults.Config
        â«½ { role = Some { enable = True, value = types.Role.wizard } }
    ```
    This import is also used internally within the package as a convenient
    import for all available types.
