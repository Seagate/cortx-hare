{-

This is just an example how gencdf.dhall can be used to generate the CDF.
gencdf exports a function that ingests a shortened description of cluster (currently shipped as single type NodeInfo). As a result it issues a ClusterDesc type that can be transformed to CDF yaml file like this:

$ dhall <<< ./test.dhall  | dhall-to-yaml >mycdf.yaml

This file should be auto-generated from Python land.
